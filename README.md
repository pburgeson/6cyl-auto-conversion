# The Problem
It is widely held in the experimental avaiation community that auto conversions are not worth the time or money.  It is believed that not only do they end up as or more expensive as a traditional air cooled aviation engine, they are much less reliable.  I aim to change that.

My mission to is design, build, and test a diesel auto converstion that is reliable and a fraction of the cost of a traditional avaition engine.  This will allow for use of jet fuel, avoids needing a double redudant ignition system, use of modern engine technology, liquid cooling, and access to low cost automotive components.

# Requirements
* Automotive diesel engine
* Greater than 250 hp
* Turbocharged
* Liquid cooled
* Available in the US
* Less than $15,000 before modifications
* Aluminum engine block
* Steel pistons
